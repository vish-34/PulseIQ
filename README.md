## 🚀 Overview

Our MVP is **production-ready**, fully functional, and runs on real APIs, real logic, and real-time simulation.

### What PulseIQ Does

* **📊 Unified Vitals Dashboard**
    * Connect wearables or health data sources and view all vitals in one clean interface.
* **🤖 Fine-Tuned Medical AI**
    * A custom-trained health assistant that explains your reports, symptoms, and trends in simple terms.
* **🚑 Crash / Accident Simulation**
    * A fully autonomous emergency workflow that shows how the system alerts hospitals, shares medical info, and pre-authorizes support.
* **🎮 Button-Triggered Demo Mode**
    * Since we can't trigger a real crash at the event, we simulate the entire workflow through an interactive button.
* **🟢 Production-Ready MVP**
    * Every feature from AI to vitals to emergency flow works end-to-end using live APIs (limited to free-tier usage).

## 🧠 How It Works

1.  **Data Collection:** The system collects vitals from wearables, apps, or manual report uploads.
2.  **AI Processing:** Our AI assistant processes and explains all health readings in human-readable language.
3.  **Emergency Trigger:** The crash flow triggers autonomously (simulated for the demo), activating:
    * 📍 Ambulance locator
    * 🏥 Hospital data sharing
    * 📋 Emergency medical dashboard
    * 🎟️ Pre-authorization token

> All components run in real-time using Node.js, React, and agentic AI logic.

## ⚡ Why PulseIQ Matters

> "Most health apps only track data — **we make sense of it**."

1.  **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Emergency tech is usually reactive; we make it autonomous.
2.  **Interoperability:** Healthcare systems don't talk to each other; PulseIQ becomes the bridge.
3.  **Clarity:** We translate complex medical data into actionable insights.

## 💼 Business Model

While we do not charge users for emergency services, PulseIQ can sustainably grow through:

* 🏥 **Hospital & Clinic Commissions** (Referrals + emergency handoff pipeline)
* 💊 **Affiliate Partnerships** with diagnostic labs & wellness programs
* 💼 **B2B Licensing** for insurance companies & healthcare providers
* 💳 **Premium Subscriptions** for advanced AI-driven health insights (Optional)
